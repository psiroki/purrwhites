# PurrWhites

Meet **PurrWhites**, a fun and effective web app designed to perfect the whites in your photos! Infused with a passion for customization and a sprinkle of cat-inspired charm, this tool empowers you to adjust white balance with expert precision.

# How to Use

Use your own image or start with the included sample: simply click a spot that should be white, and the app will automatically adjust the white balance and brightness based on that selection. Refine the results by modifying the off-white tone or tweaking the multiplier. Adjust the sample area size to fine-tune your editsâ€”this sets the sample area used whenever a spot is clicked.

Navigate the image by panning, zoom in or out with a mouse wheel, or use pinch gestures on a touchscreen for fluid navigation.
